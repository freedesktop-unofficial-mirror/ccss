Version 0.2, 2008-10-01
-----------------------

Focus on basic CSS support.

### Features ###
* Border radius.
* Background image: -attachment, -position, -repeat, -size.
* External tool `css2gtkrc` for extracting gtkrc information form stylesheets.

### Theme ###
* Use actual borders for checks and options, make them use 100% of the 
  allocated space.
* Gilouche-CSS theme somewhat closer to the original.

### Internals ###
* Have an internal instance of `ccss_style_t` with default values, `ccss_style_init()`
  initialises the style to those. Then drawing functions don't have to check
  for `NULL` pointers any more, or, at least not handle them functionally.
* Create `color` property and use it for bg- and fg-color (in `block`, `style`, ...).
* More robust parsing, handle (some) invalid CSS.
* Better stability, work around a problem in libcroco (b.g.o#553937).

Version 0.1, 2008-08-22
-----------------------

Focus on basic infrastructure.

* Matching (descendant and child).
* Background color.
* Basic border styles, also through the `color` property.
* Single background image.
