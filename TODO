ROADMAP
=======

Also see gtk-css-engine's TODO for now.

0.2
---

* Make ccss_stylesheet_new_from_file take (filename, GError)

0.3
---

* Test suite.

0.4
---

* Write our own parser (flex, bison).

Blue Sky
--------

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/-moz-image-region
* Transitions / animations? http://ejohn.org/blog/css-animations-and-javascript/

Evaluate
--------

* Consider a custom allocator (gslice?) for same-sized properties (find out how much overhead regular malloc has for small structs first).
* Move `none' and `inherit' out of the structs and into an own hash (save mem).
* Pass pseudo class(es) to the drawing function(s) instead of determining them at query time.
* Query interface through CSS selectors, see gtk-css-engine TODO.
