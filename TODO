ROADMAP
=======

Also see gtk-css-engine's TODO for now.

0.2
---

* Merge universal- and type-selector based blocks in a single step, fetching the respectively next every time. Maybe use a hash and iterators internally, instead of GTree?
* Pass pseudo class(es) to the drawing function(s) instead of determining them at query time.
* Move `none' and `inherit' out of the structs and into an own hash (save mem).
* Consider a custom allocator (gslice?) for same-sized properties (find out how much overhead regular malloc has for small structs first).
* Implement public selector-group API in terms of stylesheet?
* ccss_stylesheet_new_from_file took (filename, GError)
* Better function interface, so it can also be used for gtkrc settings:
    GtkButton {
      gtk: xthickness(3);	/* Or just "xthickness: 3;" for this special case? */
      GtkButton: child-displacement-x(0);
      GtkButton: default_border( 0, 0, 0, 0 );
    }
* Style merging by property prefix, this is needed for g-c-e, so e.g. "border-left*" can be merged from the GtkComboBox style when drawing its embedded entries' shadow.
