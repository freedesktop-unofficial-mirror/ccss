ROADMAP
=======

Also see gtk-css-engine's TODO for now.

0.5
---

* Ship clearlooks' gtkrc hacks as a separate file and include it in the themes.
* Move over gce-node, separate them.
* Improve test suite. Libxml backend for cascading tests?
* Cairo-style error handling? Or something else?
* "char * foo_serialize()" API instead of _dump().
* _serialize() property class method, serializing should fall back to _convert()
  should print url('foo').

0.6
---

* Improve test suite.
* Use slice allocator and custom list/hash implementations with in-node data.

0.7
---

* Write our own parser, probably hand-written using GScanner.

Blue Sky
--------

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/-moz-image-region
* Transitions / animations? http://ejohn.org/blog/css-animations-and-javascript/

Evaluate
--------

* Consider a custom allocator (gslice?) for same-sized properties (find out how much overhead regular malloc has for small structs first).
* Move `none' and `inherit' out of the structs and into an own hash (save mem).
* Pass pseudo class(es) to the drawing function(s) instead of determining them at query time.
* Query interface through CSS selectors, see gtk-css-engine TODO.
